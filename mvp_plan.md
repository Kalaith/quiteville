# MVP Plan

## MVP Scope (Very Realistic)

Version 0.1

- One zone (e.g., Old Homestead)
- 4 core resources (Energy, Maintenance, Attractiveness, Stability)
- Population pressure system
- Time progression + decay
- Logs as the main storytelling device

If that's fun, you already won.

## Ultra-Realistic MVP

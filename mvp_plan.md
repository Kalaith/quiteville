# MVP Plan

## MVP Scope (Very Realistic)

Version 0.1

- One structure
- 3 core systems (power, access, habitation)
- 5–10 autonomous inhabitants
- Time progression + decay
- Logs as the main storytelling device

If that's fun, you already won.

## Ultra-Realistic MVP

MVP Scope (2–4 weeks):

- 1 district
- 3 zones
- 4 resources
- Population pressure system
- Offline progression
- Log-based narrative events

If watching numbers drift already feels good, you've nailed it.</content>

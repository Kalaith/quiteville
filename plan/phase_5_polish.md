# Phase 5: Visual Polish & Juiciness (Month 5)

**Goal**: Transforming the functional simulation into a beautiful, immersive experience. "A town that whispers."

## Week 17: Audioscape
*   [ ] **Dynamic Music system**: Tracks that evolve based on town size and season.

## Week 18: Particle Effects
*   [ ] **Chimney Smoke**: Visual indicator of active housing.
*   [ ] **Weather Particles**: Rain splashes, snow accumulation.
*   [ ] **Feedback Effects**: Dust clouds when building/restoring, "hearts" when social events happen.

## Week 19: UI Overhaul
*   [ ] **Thematic UI Art**: Replacing placeholder rectangles with parchment/wood textures.
*   [ ] **Animations**: Smooth transitions for menus, "pop" effects for buttons.

## Week 20: Narrative Intro (Tutorial)
*   [ ] **The Guide**: Adding "Uncle Artie" or similar narrator character.
